# Airbnb Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project uses **Tableau** to analyze Airbnb data, focusing on different aspects such as geographical distribution, price analysis, and bed availability across various zip codes. The aim is to identify trends, provide insights on the most profitable locations, and visualize the data through an interactive dashboard.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project comes from [Airbnbâ€™s public listings data](#). It includes information such as zip codes, prices, number of beds, and other relevant details.

## Objectives
- **Identify the most profitable zip codes**: Determine which areas yield the highest average price and have the most listings.
- **Analyze price averages** based on the number of beds available in each Airbnb listing.
- **Explore bed availability** by zip code to understand supply and potential market gaps.
- **Create an interactive dashboard** that displays these insights and allows users to explore the data visually.

## Analysis and Visualizations
1. **Geographical Map**: Displays Airbnb listings across different zip codes, highlighting their distribution and density.
2. **Profitability by Zip Code**: A bar chart showing which zip codes have the highest average price per listing.
3. **Average Price per Number of Beds**: Analyzes and displays the average price based on the number of beds in each listing.
4. **Bed Availability per Zip Code**: A chart representing the total number of beds available in each zip code.

## Dashboard Overview
The Tableau dashboard combines all these visualizations into a comprehensive view, allowing users to:
- Interact with the map to see details about each zip code.
- Filter and explore profitability and price per bed category.
- Compare bed availability across different locations.

## Installation and Setup
To view and interact with the Tableau dashboard:
1. Download Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop.
2. Open the `.twbx` file included in this repository.
3. Ensure you have access to the dataset (included in this repository) for the visualizations to load properly.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate time-based analysis to see how prices and bed availability change over time.
- Add more filtering options, such as type of property and guest ratings, to provide deeper insights.
- Explore machine learning integration for predictive pricing models.
